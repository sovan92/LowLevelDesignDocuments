# How to Approach a LLD OOPS Interview (LLD)

## Design Decision 
Are we focusing on high level class diagram , code structure or full implementation. 

## 3 cases 
- HIgh Level Class Diagram
- Code Structure
- Full implementation

## What's the process 
1. Requirement gathering
2. Identifying core objects.
3. Navigating the design
4. Deep dive topics

### Requirement Gathering
Understand what's functional and non-functional requirements. Ask targetted questions to confirm any assumptions. 

### Identify core objects 
Use step by step identification of core objects and their interactions. Map nouns in the requirements to objects , Parking lot , Vehicle, Ticket .  Verb to methods . 

### Now define class diagram and code 

Top Down approach : Define the parent classes and interface and then go down . 
Bottom Up Approach: Define concrete classes , then go up . 

Say these terms : 
1. Low coupling and high cohesion .
2. How your structure will translate into code.

### Handle edge cases and resolve inconsistencies.
